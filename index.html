      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        Cruzeiro Esporte Clube (Brazilian Portuguese: [kɾuˈzejɾu esˈpoʁtʃi
        ˈklubi]), known simply as Cruzeiro, is the largest sports club based in
        Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais. Although competing in a number of
        different sports, Cruzeiro is mostly known for its association football
        team. Its football team is the most prestigious team in Belo Horizonte,
        Minas Gerais. It plays in the Campeonato Brasileiro Série A, the top
        tier of the Brazilian football league system, as well as in the
        Campeonato Mineiro, the state of Minas Gerais's premier state league.
        The club was founded on 2 January 1921, by sportsmen from the Italian
        colony of Belo Horizonte as Palestra Itália. As a result of the Second
        World War, the Brazilian federal government banned the use of any
        symbols referring to the Axis powers in 1942. The club board members
        rebaptized the club with the name of a leading national symbol: the
        Cruzeiro do Sul's constellation. Cruzeiro play their home games at the
        Mineirão stadium, which currently holds up to 62,547 spectators.
        Cruzeiro's regular kit colors are blue shirts and white shorts with
        white socks. Cruzeiro is one of Brazil's most successful clubs. It won
        the Campeonato Brasileiro Série A for the first time in 1966, after
        defeating Santos' Os Santásticos in the final series.[2] Cruzeiro has
        won the Brasileirão again in 2003, 2013 and 2014, obtaining the best
        campaign in the present format of the competition. Cruzeiro has also won
        record six Copa do Brasil titles and the Campeonato Mineiro 39 times.
        Cruzeiro won the defunct state competitions Taça Minas Gerais five
        times, the Copa dos Campeões Mineiros twice, Copa Sul Minas twice, the
        Torneio Início 10 times and the Supercampeonato Mineiro once. A Raposa
        also obtained many international laurels such as two Copa Libertadores,
        two Supercopa Libertadores, one Recopa Sudamericana, one Copa de Oro and
        one Copa Master de Supercopa. Cruzeiro is one of the two Brazilian clubs
        to complete the Domestic Treble, a feat accomplished in 2003 after
        winning the Campeonato Mineiro, the 2003 Copa do Brasil and the 2003
        Brasileirão. Cruzeiro hold a long-standing rivalry against Atlético
        Mineiro. It has contributed many key and famous players towards Brazil's
        FIFA World Cup squads such as Piazza, Tostão, Nelinho, Ronaldo, Luisão,
        Alex, Maicon, Cris, Jairzinho, Rivaldo and Edílson among so many others.
